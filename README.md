# dwm-config
Personal customisation of dwm.

The following patches have been added from the suckless patches for dwm(http://dwm.suckless.org/patches/):
alpha, barheight, colorbar, fullgaps, nrowgrid.
Eventually make sure to patch this configs with the respective patch.diff files if the make returns errors or they don't appear to be functional.

If the icons on the status bar don't show, check if the font of this config is actually installed or, if you're using a different font, make sure it supports glyphs.
